### **Subnetting in Simple Network Design**
Design and Simulation of a Simple Network System- Subnetting allocates IPs logically to groups within the same network by modifying the subnet mask using Cisco Packet Tracer.

**Definition**:  
Subnetting divides a single network into smaller sub-networks (subnets) within the same IP range, enabling efficient IP allocation, better organization, and traffic control.

**Steps**:  
1. **Understand Requirements**: Identified devices, subnets needed, and plan for scalability.  
2. **Subnet Mask Calculation**: Used 2nâ‰¥(Number of Devices + 2) to determine the mask for each group.  
3. **Assign IPs**: Allocated IPs for devices; reserved the first usable IP as the default gateway.  
4. **Test Connectivity**: Used tools like **ping** to verify inter-subnet communication.  

**Benefits**:  
- Efficient IP usage and allocation.  
- Improved performance by reducing congestion.  
- Simplified management and enhanced security.  
- Easy scalability for future growth.

This ensures logical and optimized IP address distribution for seamless network operations.
